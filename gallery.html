        <p><span class="boldIt">Why did you go?</span> To share God's love.</p>
        <p><span class="boldIt">Who are the missionaries?</span> Brian and Jerilyn White (and their 3 children) who live in Uganda, ministering full-time with East Africa Outreach.</p>
        <p><span class="boldIt">Tell us about the school.</span> Hannah Moshi is named after Hannah in the Bible who prayed to God for a child. The property used to be a burial ground for people who broke Muslim law. It has been transformed from a place of death, to a place where God is bringing new life to students.</p>

        <p><span class="boldIt">Did the students speak English?</span> The students did speak English, having learned it in classes. But, to be sure they understood in their heart language, we relied on translators during teaching times. We spent a lot of time with the translators and they became dear friends.</p>
        <p><span class="boldIt">How did the team share the gospel?</span> Above you see Kym using a storying cloth to share the story of the Bible.??? We also shared God's love with the students by spending time with them, playing soccer, learning their dances, ????</p>
        <p><span class="boldIt">How was the food?</span> They fed us well and we needed to clear our plates. We had rice and beans, pumpkin, yams, chapati (an unleavened flatbread), potatoes, and matoke (the national dish of Uganda, using a variety of banana indigenous to the country).</p>

        <p><span class="boldIt">On this trip, what did you learn about yourself, about the world, and about God?</span> I am still processing what I saw and did. I got to hear the difficult life stories as I helped students write out their life story. And I'm hoping God will continue to teach me from this trip, but I especially enjoyed the time I had to become friends with....and how taking the time to build relationships is how we build the bridges to share God's love.</p>

        <p><span class="boldIt">Thank you </span>for supporting me and praying for me as I went to Uganda. I have been blessed that you enabled me to visit another part of this world, to see God at work, and to now have dear friends in Uganda. One dear sister, sent me home with a letter for my parents, reminding us with the words from 1 Thessalonians 5:16-18, "Be joyful always, pray at all times, be thankful in all circumstances. This is what God wants from you in your life in union with Christ Jesus." Let it be so.</p>
