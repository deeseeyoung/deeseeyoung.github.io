<!--         <h3><span>01</span> The group</h3>
         -->
        <p><span class="boldIt">Where did you go?</span> We traveled 7,000 miles to Jinja, Uganda. When we arrived, we stayed with a missionary family in Jinja before traveling 45 minutes to Hannah Moshi Primary School in a more rural area.</p>
        <p><span class="boldIt">Why did you go?</span> To share God's love: by visiting the homes of children who receive sponsorship to attend school; by helping run a camp at the school where we helped with inductive Bible studies; by spending time with the kids and staff playing football (soccer) and card games, and learning their dances.</p>
        <p><span class="boldIt">Who are the missionaries?</span> Brian and Jerilyn White (and their 3 children) who live in Uganda, ministering full-time with East Africa Outreach.</p>
        <p><span class="boldIt">Tell us about the school.</span> Hannah Moshi is named after Hannah in the Bible who prayed to God for a child. The property used to be a burial ground for people who broke Muslim law. It has been transformed from a place of death, to a place where God is bringing new life to students.</p>

        <p><span class="boldIt">Did the students speak English?</span> The students speak limited English, having learned it in classes. But, to be sure they understood in their heart language, we relied on translators during teaching times. We spent a lot of time with the translators and they became dear friends.</p>
        <p><span class="boldIt">How did the team share the gospel?</span> Above you see Kym using a storying cloth to share the story of the Bible during a Sunday School lesson. We also shared God's love with the students by living and eating with them, playing football (soccer), and learning their dances.</p>
        <p><span class="boldIt">How was the food?</span> They fed us well and we needed to clear our plates. We had rice and beans, pumpkin, yams, chapati (an unleavened flatbread), potatoes, and matoke (the national dish of Uganda, using a variety of banana indigenous to the country). Another common item was posha, made with cornmeal and sits like cement in your stomach. And we drank a lot of African milky sweet Masala Chai.</p>

        <p><span class="boldIt">On this trip, what did you learn about yourself, about the world, and about God?</span> I am still processing what I saw and did. I heard the difficult life stories as I helped students create life maps for their sponsors. I'm trusting God will continue to teach me from this trip, but I especially enjoyed the time I had to become friends with Sarah, Esther, Joy, Sandra, Shivana, Annett, and Gloria. And I saw how taking the time to build relationships is how we build the bridges to share God's love.</p>

        <p>I learned how unnecessary many of our 'necessities' are. I was able to live without plumbing, without a shower or toilet. We all used squatty potties, buckets of water to bathe and wash our clothing. It put things in perspective. Their way of life is hard, yet, simple and humbling.</p>

        <p><span class="boldIt">Thank you </span>for supporting me and praying for me as I went to Uganda. I have been blessed that you enabled me to visit another part of this world, to see God at work, and to now have dear friends in Uganda. One friend, sent me home with a letter for my parents, reminding us with the words from 1 Thessalonians 5:16-18, "Be joyful always, pray at all times, be thankful in all circumstances. This is what God wants from you in your life in union with Christ Jesus." Let it be so.</p>
